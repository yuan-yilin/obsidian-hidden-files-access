# Show Hidden Files — Obsidian Plugin

Reveals hidden dotfiles (`.claude/`, `.gitignore`, `.env`, `.github/`, etc.) and all file types directly in the Obsidian file explorer.

## Features

- **Show all file types** — Exposes files with unsupported extensions (`.json`, `.yml`, `.toml`, etc.) in the file explorer. Synced with Obsidian's native "Detect all file extensions" setting.
- **Show hidden files** — Shows files and folders whose names start with a dot, which Obsidian hides by default.

Both settings are **enabled by default** when the plugin is activated and **fully reverted** when the plugin is disabled.

> **Note:** Enabling this plugin exposes sensitive dotfiles (`.env`, `.git-credentials`, etc.) in the Obsidian file explorer, making them viewable, editable, and deletable. Make sure you understand what these files are before modifying them.

## Installation

### From Community Plugins (recommended)

1. Open **Settings → Community plugins → Browse**
2. Search for **Show Hidden Files**
3. Click **Install**, then **Enable**

### Manual

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` (if present) from the [latest release](https://github.com/witi42/obsidian-show-hidden-files/releases/latest).
2. Create the folder `.obsidian/plugins/show-hidden-files/` inside your vault.
3. Copy the downloaded files into that folder.
4. Open **Settings → Community plugins**, refresh the list, and enable **Show Hidden Files**.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 显示所有文件类型 (Show all file types) | On | Toggle unsupported file extensions in the explorer. Mirrors Obsidian's native "Detect all file extensions" option. |
| 显示隐藏文件 (Show hidden files) | On | Toggle dotfiles and dotfolders in the explorer. `.obsidian` and `.trash` are always excluded. |
| 显示符号链接 (Show symlinks) | On | Reveal symlinks pointing inside the vault and their target content (Obsidian only reveals symlinks pointing outside the vault natively). Multiple links to the same target are expanded once to avoid loops. Symlinks are visually marked in the explorer (italic, muted, `↗` suffix) to distinguish them from regular files. |
| 隐藏项过滤模式 (Filter mode) | 显示全部 | `显示全部` reveals everything hidden; `仅显示指定项` reveals only listed entries (and their contents); `仅排除指定项` hides listed entries (and their contents). |
| 指定项列表 (Filter list) | empty | One entry per line. A bare name (`.git`) matches same-named items at any depth; a path (`folder/.claude`) matches that path's subtree. In 仅显示 mode, ancestors of listed entries are revealed automatically. |

## Building from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/witi42/obsidian-show-hidden-files.git
cd obsidian-show-hidden-files
npm install
npm run build
```

This produces `main.js` in the project root. Copy it along with `manifest.json` into your vault's plugin folder to test.

For development with hot-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## How it works

- **Show all file types** uses Obsidian's internal `vault.setConfig('showUnsupportedFiles', …)` API to toggle the native setting programmatically.
- **Show hidden files** intercepts the vault adapter's `reconcileDeletion` and `listRecursiveChild` methods — when Obsidian tries to hide a dotfile or dotfolder, the plugin re-registers it instead. Patching the recursive walker (`listRecursiveChild`) makes hidden folders at any depth — not just one level below the vault root — get traversed and revealed. A full vault rescan via `listRecursive` triggers discovery of all dotfiles on startup.
- On disable, both settings are restored to their previous values and all revealed dotfiles are hidden again.

## Compatibility

- **Desktop only** — relies on Node.js filesystem APIs for dotfile discovery.
- Requires Obsidian **v0.15.0+**.
